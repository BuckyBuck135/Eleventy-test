Hello everyone,I've been playing with the Intermediate kit (11ty + Nunjucks + DecapCMS) and have been able to add pages, add blog content, change the navigation etc.

But my objective is to make every page editable via the CMS. I am comfortable with consuming data from a traditional API with fetch() requests, but I don't understand how the 11ty and Nunjucks actually fetch the data from the CMS. I haven't found any syntax information on that particular topic in Decap documentation.

Working on the Intermediate kit, I'm trying to figure out the logic and flow looking at the blog as an example. I've narrowed it down to a few moving pieces, but I'm not able to stitch (pun intended) them together:

\- content/pages/blog.
